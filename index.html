				<p>Drake was raised in two Toronto neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west
					end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the <a

						Wings</a>.He then moved to one of the
					city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.When asked about the move, Drake replied,
					"[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half.
					I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was
					what we could afford."</p>

			<div class="text-career">
				<p>At the age of 15, Drake, eager to begin his career as an actor, was introduced to a high school friend's
					father, an acting agent.The agent found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi:_The_Next_Generation" target="_blank"
						title="Read More">Degrassi: The
						Next Generation</a>. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks,a basketball star who became physically disabled
					after
					he was shot by a classmate. Drake reportedly disliked this character arc because of its apparent tokenism
					(his was one of the only black characters in the series), and he also believed it could negatively
					influence his standing as a rapper. Longtime series writer James Hurst said that Drake threatened legal
					action to redo the storyline, before ultimately agreeing to it.Madeleine Robinson, the executive
					director of the Californian non-profit organization Wheelchair 4 Kids, praised the storyline and Drake's
					performance, noting "he instilled confidence and representation" to disabled youth.When asked about
					his early acting career, Drake replied, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only
					money I had coming in was [from] Canadian TV."[30] He appeared in a total of 100 episodes between 2001
					and 2008.In 2010, Drake expressed interest in playing Barack Obama in a biopic, to which Obama
					responded with approval in an interview in 2020.</p>
				<p>According to Degrassi series creators Stephen Stohn and Linda Schuyler, Drake regularly arrived late on
					set after spending nights recording music. To prevent this, Schuyler claimed Drake struck an agreement
					with the set's security guards to gain entry to the set after recording to be allowed to sleep in a
					dressing room.</p>
